# Feature Specification Document: [Feature Name]

## 1. Executive Summary

-   **Feature**: [A clear, concise name for the feature]
-   **Status**: [e.g., Planned, In Progress, Implemented, Deferred]
-   **Summary**: [A brief, one-paragraph summary of the feature. What is it, and what is its primary purpose? This should be understandable by both technical and non-technical stakeholders.]

## 2. Problem Statement & Goals

-   **Problem**: [Describe the user pain point or business problem this feature is intended to solve. Why is this feature necessary? What issue will it address?]
-   **Goals**: [List the primary objectives of the feature. What should it achieve? These should be specific and measurable.]
    -   Goal 1: ...
    -   Goal 2: ...
-   **Success Metrics**: [How will we know if the feature is successful? List quantifiable metrics.]
    -   Metric 1: ...
    -   Metric 2: ...

## 3. Scope

-   **In Scope:** [Clearly list everything that is included in this feature. Be specific.]
    -   ...
    -   ...
-   **Out of Scope:** [Explicitly list what is **not** included. This is crucial for preventing scope creep and managing expectations.]
    -   ...
    -   ...

## 4. User Stories

[Describe the feature from the perspective of different user roles. Use the standard "As a..., I want..., so that..." format.]

-   As a **[User Type/Role]**, I want **[to perform an action]** so that **[I can achieve a benefit]**.
-   As a **[Another User Type/Role]**, I want **[to perform an action]** so that **[I can achieve a benefit]**.

## 5. Acceptance Criteria

[Define the specific, testable conditions that must be met for the feature to be considered complete. Use the Gherkin (Given/When/Then) syntax for clarity.]

-   **Scenario: [A clear description of the scenario]**
    -   **Given**: [The initial state or precondition]
    -   **When**: [The action performed by the user]
    -   **Then**: [The expected outcome or result]
    -   **And**: [An additional outcome, if necessary]

-   **Scenario: [Another scenario]**
    -   **Given**: ...
    -   **When**: ...
    -   **Then**: ...

## 6. Technical Design & Implementation

[This section is typically filled out by the engineering team. It outlines the technical approach.]

-   **High-Level Approach**: [Describe the overall technical strategy. Will new components be created? Will existing ones be modified? Are there any new libraries or APIs involved?]
-   **Component Breakdown**: [List the new or modified components (e.g., React components, backend services).]
    -   `NewComponent.tsx`: ...
    -   `ExistingService.ts`: ...
-   **API Endpoints**: [If applicable, describe any new or changed API endpoints.]
-   **Key Logic**: [Detail any complex algorithms or business logic.]

## 7. UI/UX Flow & Requirements

-   **User Flow**: [Describe the step-by-step journey the user takes to interact with this feature. This can be a simple numbered list or a more complex flow diagram.]
    1.  User starts at [Screen A].
    2.  User clicks [Button B].
    3.  User is taken to [Screen C] and sees [UI Element D].
-   **Visual Design**: [Link to mockups, wireframes, or prototypes from design tools like Figma, Sketch, etc. If not available, provide a text description of the UI.]
-   **Copywriting**: [List any new user-facing text, such as button labels, titles, error messages, or instructions.]

## 8. Data Management & Schema

[Describe how data is created, stored, accessed, or modified by this feature.]

### 8.1. Data Source

[Where does the data come from? (e.g., User input, API call, local storage)]

### 8.2. Data Schema

[If there is a new or modified data structure, define it here. For example, a JSON object schema.]
```json
{
  "key": "type",
  "description": "A description of the key"
}
```

### 8.3. Persistence

[How and where is the data stored? (e.g., In-memory state, `localStorage`, a remote database).]

## 9. Limitations & Known Issues

[Be transparent about any trade-offs, constraints, or known issues with the proposed implementation.]

-   **Limitation 1**: [e.g., This feature will not work in older browsers like IE11.]
-   **Known Issue 1**: [e.g., Large datasets may cause performance degradation.]

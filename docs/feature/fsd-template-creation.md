# Feature Specification Document: FSD Template Creation

## 1. Executive Summary

-   **Feature**: Standardized Feature Specification Document (FSD) Template
-   **Status**: Implemented
-   **Summary**: This feature establishes a standardized Markdown template for creating Feature Specification Documents. Its purpose is to ensure consistency, thoroughness, and clarity across all future feature planning and documentation, improving team collaboration, reducing ambiguity, and streamlining the development process.

## 2. Problem Statement & Goals

-   **Problem**: Without a standardized template, feature specifications are created ad-hoc. This leads to inconsistency in structure, missing critical information (like "Out of Scope" sections or "Acceptance Criteria"), and increased cognitive load for team members who must parse a different document format each time. This can cause ambiguity, scope creep, and communication breakdowns between stakeholders.
-   **Goals**:
    -   Establish a single, consistent, and predictable format for all FSDs.
    -   Ensure all critical aspects of a feature (problem, scope, user stories, technical design, etc.) are considered and documented during the planning phase.
    -   Streamline the FSD creation process for authors (e.g., Product Managers, Tech Leads).
    -   Improve the readability and utility of FSDs for all consumers (e.g., Developers, QA Engineers, Designers).
-   **Success Metrics**:
    -   All new feature specifications created after the template's introduction follow the new format.
    -   A measurable reduction in clarification questions from the engineering team during development sprints.
    -   Positive feedback from the team regarding the clarity and usefulness of new FSDs.

## 3. Scope

-   **In Scope:**
    -   Creating a single, comprehensive Markdown template file (`feature-spec-template.md`).
    -   Defining all key sections required for a thorough feature specification.
    -   Including placeholder text and instructional comments within the template to guide the author.
    -   Storing the template in a logical, accessible location within the project's `docs/` directory.
-   **Out of Scope:**
    -   Creating multiple template variations for different types of tasks (e.g., a "lite" spec for bugs).
    -   Automating the creation of new FSDs from the template via scripts or CLI tools.
    -   Enforcing template usage via CI/CD checks or other automated validation.
    -   Retroactively migrating all existing FSDs to the new template format.

## 4. User Stories

-   As a **Product Manager**, I want a standardized template for writing feature specs so that I can create comprehensive and clear documentation more efficiently without forgetting key details.
-   As a **Developer**, I want all feature specs to follow a consistent structure so that I can quickly find the information I need (like acceptance criteria and technical design) and begin implementation with less ambiguity.
-   As a **QA Engineer**, I want a dedicated "Acceptance Criteria" section in a predictable format so that I can easily and accurately derive my test plans.
-   As a **New Team Member**, I want to read FSDs based on a template so that I can quickly understand our team's process for defining and documenting work.

## 5. Acceptance Criteria

-   **Scenario: Author creates a new FSD using the template**
    -   **Given**: An author needs to specify a new feature.
    -   **When**: They navigate to the `docs/templates` directory and copy the `feature-spec-template.md` file.
    -   **Then**: The new file contains all the predefined sections from the template (Executive Summary, Scope, etc.).
    -   **And**: The file includes placeholder text and instructions that guide the author on what to write in each section.

-   **Scenario: Team member reads an FSD based on the template**
    -   **Given**: A team member opens an FSD that was created from the template.
    -   **When**: They scan the document.
    -   **Then**: They can easily locate specific sections like "Acceptance Criteria" or "Out of Scope" due to the consistent structure and Markdown headings.

## 6. Technical Design & Implementation

-   **High-Level Approach**: The feature is purely a documentation asset. The implementation consists of creating a single, well-structured Markdown file. The "design" is the logical structure of the document itself.
-   **File Creation**: A new file named `feature-spec-template.md` is created inside the `docs/templates/` directory to facilitate easy discovery and reuse.
-   **Content Structure**: The file is structured using standard Markdown headers (`#`, `##`, `###`). Its content is a synthesis of the best practices observed in the project's existing FSDs (`local-storage-persistence.md`, `export-functionality.md`, etc.), ensuring it is tailored to the team's needs.

## 7. UI/UX Flow & Requirements

-   This feature does not have a software UI. The "user experience" is that of the document author and reader.
-   **Author Flow**:
    1.  The user needs to write a new FSD.
    2.  They locate the template at `docs/templates/feature-spec-template.md`.
    3.  They copy the file to a new location (e.g., `docs/feature/new-cool-feature.md`).
    4.  They fill in the sections as guided by the template's structure and instructional text.
-   **Copywriting**: The instructional text within the template is designed to be clear, concise, and helpful to the author.

## 8. Data Management & Schema

-   Not applicable. This is a static documentation file and does not handle application data.

## 9. Limitations & Known Issues

This section documents the potential pitfalls ("cons") of introducing a standardized template.

-   **Risk of Rigidity**: A "one-size-fits-all" template may not be suitable for every task. Using a full-blown FSD for a minor bug fix or a tiny UI tweak can feel like excessive bureaucracy and may lead to developers skipping the process.

-   **Maintenance Overhead**: The template is not a "set-it-and-forget-it" document. As the team's processes evolve, the template will require updates to remain relevant. This necessitates clear ownership and periodic reviews.

-   **"Filling out the Form" Mentality**: There is a risk that authors might focus more on completing every section of the template rather than engaging in the critical thinking required to define the feature well. The template could become a substitute for thoughtful analysis instead of a guide for it.

-   **Adoption is Manual**: The template's effectiveness relies on team discipline. There is no automated enforcement to ensure it is used. Team members could forget to use it or deviate from its structure.

# Feature Specification Document: User-Provided API Keys

## 1. Executive Summary

-   **Feature**: User-Provided API Keys for AI Translation
-   **Status**: **Rejected**
-   **Summary**: This document outlines a proposed feature to allow users to enter their own Gemini API key into the application to enable AI translation features. After careful consideration, this proposal has been **rejected**. The significant security vulnerabilities and negative impact on user experience outweigh the benefits of offloading API costs. The application will adhere to the industry-best-practice of managing API keys securely on a server-side backend, accessed via `process.env.API_KEY`.

## 2. Problem Statement & Goals

-   **Problem**: The AI translation feature requires API calls that may incur costs and require backend infrastructure to manage securely. An alternative approach could be to offload this responsibility to the user, thereby eliminating backend costs and complexity for the application owner.
-   **Goals (of the proposed, rejected feature)**:
    -   Enable the AI translation feature without requiring the application developer to host a backend or pay for API calls.
    -   Give power users control over their own API usage and associated costs.
-   **Success Metrics (Hypothetical)**:
    -   A user could successfully enter their API key and use the translation feature.
    -   API calls to the Gemini model would be made directly from the client-side using the user's key.

## 3. Scope

-   **In Scope (Hypothetical):**
    -   A UI element (e.g., an input field in a settings panel) for users to enter and save their Gemini API key.
    -   Storing the user's API key in the browser's `localStorage`.
    -   A prominent warning message to the user about the inherent security risks of client-side key storage.
    -   Modifying the AI translation logic to use the user-provided key from `localStorage`.
-   **Out of Scope:**
    -   A secure, server-side proxy for API calls (this is the chosen alternative, not part of this rejected feature).
    -   Backend validation or management of user keys.

## 4. User Stories

-   As a **power user**, I want to provide my own Gemini API key so that I can use the AI translation feature under my own usage quota and without limitation from the application owner.
-   As an **application owner**, I want users to provide their own keys so that I don't have to bear the financial cost or operational complexity of managing a backend for their API calls.

## 5. Acceptance Criteria

-   **Scenario: User configures and uses their API key (Hypothetical)**
    -   **Given**: A user has a valid Gemini API key.
    -   **When**: They enter the key into the settings input field and save it.
    -   **Then**: The key is stored in `localStorage`.
    -   **And**: When they click the "AI Translate" button, the feature works correctly using their key.

## 6. Technical Design & Implementation

The proposed implementation involved adding a state to hold the user's API key, an input field to set it, and saving the key to `localStorage`. The `handleAiTranslate` function would then be modified to initialize the `GoogleGenAI` client with the user's key if present.

**This entire approach has been rejected for the reasons outlined in Section 9.**

## 7. UI/UX Flow & Requirements

The proposed user flow would require a user to:
1.  Navigate away from the application to Google AI Studio.
2.  Go through the process of creating a project and generating an API key.
3.  Navigate back to the application.
4.  Find a settings panel.
5.  Paste the API key into an input field, read and acknowledge a security warning, and save the key.
6.  Only then could they use the AI translation feature.

This multi-step, high-friction process was a major factor in the feature's rejection.

## 8. Data Management & Schema

-   **Persistence**: The proposal was to store the raw API key as a plain text string in the browser's `localStorage`.
-   **Security**: `localStorage` is not a secure storage mechanism. It is easily accessible via JavaScript, making any stored keys vulnerable to theft through Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks or malicious browser extensions.

## 9. Limitations & Known Issues (Rationale for Rejection)

This section details the critical flaws that led to the rejection of this feature.

-   **Critical Security Risk**: This is the primary reason for rejection. Storing an API key on the client-side is fundamentally insecure. It exposes the user's secret key to theft, which could lead to abuse of their Google Cloud account, potentially resulting in significant financial costs for the user. A simple warning message is not sufficient to mitigate this severe risk.

-   **Poor User Experience (High Friction)**: The feature would require a complex, multi-step setup process outside of the application. The vast majority of users do not have a Gemini API key readily available. This creates a significant barrier to entry, and many users would abandon the feature rather than complete the setup. It violates the "it just works" principle of world-class software.

-   **Increased Support & Error-Handling Complexity**: The application would need to handle a new class of user-specific errors, such as invalid keys, expired keys, or keys that have exceeded their quota. This complicates the user experience and increases the support burden.

-   **Contradiction with Best Practices**: The secure and industry-standard method for handling API keys is to keep them on a trusted server and expose them via a backend proxy. The application's current design, which assumes the key is in `process.env.API_KEY`, already aligns with this best practice. Implementing a client-side key feature would be a direct regression from this secure model.
